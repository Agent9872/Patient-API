# PatientApi - Blazor Application  

## Project Description  
The PatientApi project is a Blazor-based web application designed to manage patient records. It allows users to:  

âœ… Create, read, update, and delete patient information.  
âœ… Manage medical records associated with each patient.  
âœ… Use Entity Framework Core for seamless data access.  
âœ… Ensure code reliability through xUnit unit tests.  

The project is built with modern web development practices and provides a scalable and maintainable solution for healthcare data management.  

---

## Technology Stack  
- .NET 9 (Blazor WebAssembly & Blazor Server)  
- Entity Framework Core (for database interactions)  
- SQLite / SQL Server (switchable database backends)  
- xUnit (for unit testing)  
- Dependency Injection (for better code maintainability)  
- Docker (optional for containerization)

## Thought Process Behind Implementation  

### 1. Architecture  
The project follows a layered architecture:  

ðŸ”¹ Data Layer: Handles database interactions via PatientApiDbContext using Entity Framework Core.  
ðŸ”¹ Model Layer: Defines core data models like Patient and PatientRecord.  
ðŸ”¹ Service Layer: Implements business logic via PatientRecordService.  
ðŸ”¹ Presentation Layer: Uses Blazor components to render UI and manage user interactions.

## Key Design Decisions  

### 1. Use of Entity Framework Core  
âœ” Why? Simplifies database operations and migrations.  
âœ” How? The `PatientApiDbContext` class is configured for:  
   - In-memory database (for testing).  
   - SQL Server or SQLite (for production).  

### 2. In-Memory Database for Testing  
âœ” Why? Enables fast, isolated unit tests without needing a real database.  
âœ” How? The `PatientRecordServiceTests` class uses DbContextOptions to configure an in-memory database for testing.  

### 3. Blazor for UI  
âœ” Why? Provides a modern, component-based UI framework using C#.  
âœ” How? The project includes Razor components and Blazor pages to display and manage patient records interactively.  

### 4. Separation of Concerns (SoC)  
âœ” Why? Improves maintainability and testability.  
âœ” How? The project is structured into separate layers:  
   - Models for data structures.  
   - Services for business logic.  
   - DbContext for database interactions.  

### 5. Unit Testing with xUnit  
âœ” Why? Ensures reliability of core functionalities.  
âœ” How? The `PatientRecordServiceTests` class includes tests for:  
   - Creating, updating, and retrieving patient records.

## Docker Configuration  
Here is the Dockerfile used for running the project in a containerized environment:

```dockerfile
# See https://aka.ms/customizecontainer to learn how to customize your debug container and how Visual Studio uses this Dockerfile to build your images for faster debugging.

# Depending on the operating system of the host machines(s) that will build or run the containers, the image specified in the FROM statement may need to be changed.
# For more information, please see https://aka.ms/containercompat

# This stage is used when running from VS in fast mode (Default for Debug configuration)
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0-nanoserver-1809 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 8081


# This stage is used to build the service project
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0-nanoserver-1809 AS build
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["Patient-API.csproj", "."]
RUN dotnet restore "./Patient-API.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "./Patient-API.csproj" -c %BUILD_CONFIGURATION% -o /app/build

# This stage is used to publish the service project to be copied to the final stage
FROM build AS publish
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
RUN dotnet publish "./Patient-API.csproj" -c %BUILD_CONFIGURATION% -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false

# This stage is used in production or when running from VS in regular mode (Default when not using the Debug configuration)
FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Patient-API.dll"]
```
